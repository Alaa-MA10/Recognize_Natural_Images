# Recognize Natural Images

## Kaggle Deep Learning Competition

- The goal of the competition is to build deep learning models that can recognize the category of the natural images.
  This dataset contains natural images of size 150x150 for 6 categories (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and
  street). The training set contains 6 folders, around 2300 for each category. The testing set contains 3050 images. The
  goal is to build a model that can recognize the category of each image in the testing set with high accuracy.
